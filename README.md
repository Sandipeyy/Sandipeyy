# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sandipeyy!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm passionate about learning, exploring, and building cool things. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and making projects that make life easier (or just more fun).

## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few things I've been working on (or dreaming up):

- [FunWeatherApp](https://github.com/Sandipeyy/FunWeatherApp) – A weather app that tells you if you need an umbrella (with a fun fact!).
- [SimpleToDo](https://github.com/Sandipeyy/SimpleToDo) – A minimalist to-do list app to keep life organized.
- [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/Sandipeyy/portfolio) – My personal website, built with love and a bit of JavaScript.
- [More Coming Soon!](#) – I’m always tinkering with new ideas. Stay tuned!
